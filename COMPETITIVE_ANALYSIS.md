## 💰 Cost Efficiency Analysis

### **Cloudflare Workers Deployment Costs**

#### Your API on Cloudflare (Self-Hosted)
```
Free Tier: 100,000 requests/day
- Health checks: Free
- 10 watchers × 48 checks/day (30min) = 480 checks/day
- Result: COMPLETELY FREE under 100K/day

Paid Plan: $5/month (unlimited requests)
- Unlimited watchers
- Unlimited checks
- Unlimited API calls
- Global edge deployment included
```

#### Competitor Costs for Same Usage

**Scenario: 10 watchers, checking every 30 minutes (48 checks/day = 14,400 checks/month)**

| Provider | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| **YOUR API** | **$0 (free tier) or $5 (paid)** | Unlimited after hitting paid tier |
| Visualping | $50/mo | Personal plan (10K checks) won't cover it |
| Hexowatch | $55/mo | Professional plan needed |
| Distill.io | $15/mo | Starter barely covers it |
| ChangeTower | $9/mo | 1,500 checks limit exceeded |
| ChangeDetection.io | $8.99/mo | 5,000 URLs but limited features |

**💡 Your API is 3-11x cheaper** for equivalent monitoring.

### **3. Cost Efficiency**

**Example: Enterprise monitoring (100 watchers, hourly checks)**

Monthly checks: 100 watchers × 24 checks/day × 30 days = **72,000 checks**

| Provider | Monthly Cost | Cost per Check |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| **YOUR API** | **$5** | **$0.000069** |
| Visualping | $100-250 | $0.0014-0.0035 |
